Hi! I am a final-year undergraduate student pursuing Electronics and Communication Engineering at [IIITDM Kancheepuram.](https://www.iiitdm.ac.in/). Throughout my academic journey, I've sharped my skills through diverse projects and internships. I have been part of several hackathons and competitions, developing solutions that address real-world problems.

Currently, I am working as an Electronics Engineer Intern at [UTSAAH Lab, CPDM, IISc, Bengaluru](https://cpdm.iisc.ac.in/utsaah/), where I am actively involved in developing and optimizing firmware solutions for smart-wearable applications. I took on challenges ranging from low-level bit manipulation to high-level code optimization, all while ensuring the seamless integration of hardware and software components. I have also completed 6-months internship at [Titan Company Limited, Bengaluru](https://www.titancompany.in/). My time at Titan allowed me to gain invaluable hands-on experience in the industry and enhance my problem-solving skills in real-world scenarios.

My aspiration is to make a significant contribution in new product development. I aim to be at the forefront of pioneering technologies that redefine the boundaries of what's possible. By continuously learning and staying up to date with the latest trends and advancements, I seek to carve a path that not only fuels my curiosity but also positively impacts the world we live in.

Feel free to reach out if you'd like to discuss ideas, collaborate on projects, or simply share your insights.
