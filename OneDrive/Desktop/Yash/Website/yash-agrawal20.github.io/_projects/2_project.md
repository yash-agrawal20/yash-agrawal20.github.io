Every picture is worth 1,000 words. Well, in this case the thousands of words and many hours were put into these projects.

I have a list of computer vision projects with all the source code [here](https://github.com/SpencerPao/ComputerVision)

More is to come. There are many applications that can be done. How exciting!

Can I call myself the next Pablo Picasso? Well, maybe my computer can come close to Picasso's greatness.
